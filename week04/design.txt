YouTube Video Program
// The YouTube Video program models a simple system for storing and displaying information about online videos. 
Each Video object keeps track of its title, author, length, and a list of associated Comment objects. 
The program creates several videos, adds multiple comments to each one, and then displays all the details by calling methods that return formatted information about the video and its comments. 
The classes work together by having Video manage its collection of Comment objects, while each Comment is responsible only for storing and presenting its own data. 
This demonstrates abstraction by organizing related responsibilities into classes.
    
    Video
        _length : int
        _title : string
        _author : string
        _comments : List<Comment>

        Video(length: int, title : string, author : string)

        NewComment(Comment : Comment): void

        GetNumComments(): int

        GetDisplayVideo(): string

    Comment
        _name : string
        _text : string

        Comment(name: string, text: string)

        GetDisplayComments(): string



Online Ordering Program

//The Online Ordering program is an online ordering system coordinating four classes: Order, Product, Customer, and Address. 
An Order contains a list of Product objects and a Customer, and it uses these relationships to calculate the total price, generate packing labels, and produce shipping labels. 
Each Product knows its own cost and identifying information, while Customer and Address work together to determine shipping location and format the shipping label. 
The program shows encapsulation by keeping data private within each class and exposing only the methods needed to compute totals and display order information.

    Order
        _products : List<Product>
        _customer : Customer

        Order(Customer: Customer)

        NewProduct(Product: Product): void
        
        GetTotalPrice(): double

        GetPacking(): string

        GetShipping(): string


    Product
        _name : string  
        _productID : string
        _price : double
        _quantity : int

        Product(name : string, productID : string, price : double, quantity : int)
        
        GetTotalCost(): double
        
        GetPackingLabel(): string


    Customer
        _name : string
        _address :  Address
     
        Customer(name : string, address : Address)
        
        IsUSA(): bool
        
        GetShippingLabel(): string

    Address
        _streetAddress : string
        _city : string
        _stateProvince : string
        _country : string

        Address(streetAddress : string, city : string, stateProvince : string, country : string)
        
        IsUSA(): bool
        
        GetShipping(): string
