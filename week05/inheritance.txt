Inheritance
//Explain the meaning of Inheritance.
Inheritance is a component of object-oriented programming that allows a parent-child relationship in classes.
This means that you can pass along methods and parameters from one parent class to multiple child classes.
This allows for clean programming for linking related child classes to a parent class.

//Highlight a benefit of Inheritance.
A benefit of inheritance is that you will be able to use code from the parent class and not have to re-type it for each class.
This also will streamline programming for updates for the main class.

//Provide an application of Inheritance.
An example of inheritance is from our class assignment.
In our assignment, we discussed that a book class (parent class) can contain a title and author.
A child class could be for PictureBook and include illustrator.

//Use a code example of Inheritance from the program you wrote. (You should copy and paste a few lines of code that demonstrate the use of the principle.)
In the program created this week, here is an example of using inheritance to pass along this code from the Activity class to other classes: 
"public void DisplayStartingMessage()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Welcome to the {_name} activity.");
        Console.WriteLine(_description);
        Console.Write("Enter the duration in seconds: ");
        _duration = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
        Console.WriteLine("Get ready to begin ...");
        ShowSpinner(3);
    }"
    Also here is an example showing that a class is a child of the Activity class:
    "public class BreathingActivity : Activity"
