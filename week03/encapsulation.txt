//Explain the meaning of Encapsulation.

Encapusulation is a way that you can confine variables to a specific class.
All the methods in the class will be able to access these variables; however, they will be contained themselves in the class and not accessible to other classes.
This allows a separation of details to a specific class so that only public methods are shared from the class.
It can allow for easier distinction and updates later as the variables are contained in one class and not passed between classes.


//Highlight a benefit of Encapsulation.

A benefit of encapsulation is that you can protect your data. When you use encapsulation to create private variables, these are not shared to other classes.
This way, you can determine using class methods what you want to be available to pass between classes.
Also, the code that is set to private in a class is unable to be access outside of the specific class which is more privacy.


//Provide an application of Encapsulation.

An application of encapuslation is from our class example with the bank account.
Using private featutre, we can keep the balance in a separate hidden status and pass deposit/withdrawal information without accessing the account balance (if that is set to private, for example).
This will allow only the information that we want to be accessible from a specific part of a program.



//Use a code example of Encapsulation from the program you wrote.
