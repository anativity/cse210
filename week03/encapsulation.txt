//Explain the meaning of Encapsulation.

Encapusulation is a way that you can confine variables to a specific class.
All the methods in the class will be able to access these variables; however, they will be contained themselves in the class and not accessible to other classes.
This allows a separation of details to a specific class so that only public methods are shared from the class.
It can allow for easier distinction and updates later as the variables are contained in one class and not passed between classes.


//Highlight a benefit of Encapsulation.

A benefit of encapsulation is that you can protect your data. When you use encapsulation to create private variables, these are not shared to other classes.
This way, you can determine using class methods what you want to be available to pass between classes.
Also, the code that is set to private in a class is unable to be access outside of the specific class which is more privacy.


//Provide an application of Encapsulation.

An application of encapuslation is from our class example with the bank account.
Using private featutre, we can keep the balance in a separate hidden status and pass deposit/withdrawal information without accessing the account balance (if that is set to private, for example).
This will allow only the information that we want to be accessible from a specific part of a program.



//Use a code example of Encapsulation from the program you wrote. 
An example of Encapsulation from the code I wrote is found in the Reference.cs file.
In this example, the variables that store the Book, Chapter, and Verse were set to private, but are available to be constructed in a public method which will allow them to pass into the Program.
This protects the data while still allowing the Program class to use the Reference object.
See the following example:
"public class Reference
{
    private string _book;
    private int _chapter;
    private int _verse;
    private int _endVerse;

    public Reference(string book, int chapter, int verse)
    {
        _book = book;
        _chapter = chapter; 
        _verse = verse;
        _endVerse = 0;
    }"
